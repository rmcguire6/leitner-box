# LEITNER BOX

## Overview

The Leitner box is a tool for using spaced repetition to memorize and remember anything forever.
This app takes a very simple approach.
The user decides the number of new cards per day that they are going to add. The app then allows the user to create that many new cards and then loads the practice page.
The new cards for the day are presented first and then the old cards. Any cards that are missed are shown again until all the cards are correctly remembered.

## Features

- The user can create their user settings: their name and the number of new cards they want to create each day.
- The user can create their new cards which are verified by the user and immediately saved to the database.
- The user can use their cards to memorize by vocalizing the answer, clicking the card to see the correct answer, and marking their answer right or wrong. If the user answers wrong the card is put into the undone queue.
- When the user answers all current cards correctly the user sees congratulations, statistics on correctnes, and a reminder to memorize again tomorrow.
- When the user opens the application again they immediately see the card creation section.
