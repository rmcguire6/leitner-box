# LEITNER BOX

## Overview

The Leitner box is a tool for using spaced repetition to memorize and remember anything forever.
This app takes a very simple approach.
The user decides the number of new cards per day that they are going to add. The app then allows the user to create that many new cards and then loads the practice page.
The old cards for the day are presented first and then the new cards. Any cards that are missed are shown again until all the cards are correctly remembered.
